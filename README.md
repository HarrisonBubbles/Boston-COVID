# A Comparative Study of Boston's Approach to COVID-19
This repo is the final project to the INSH 2102 ("Bostonography") course at Northeastern University.

## Setup
Make sure you have a way to open .ipynb (Python notebook) files. This is commonly done in one of two ways:
* Download and run [Jupyter.](https://jupyter.org/)
* Load the notebooks on your browser through [Google Colab.](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true)

From there, start with the notebook entitled *Main Project Notebook.ipynb.* More information is given from there.
