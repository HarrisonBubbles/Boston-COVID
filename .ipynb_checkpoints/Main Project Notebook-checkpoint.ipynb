    "## Motivation and Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, Boston has adhered to the state of Massachusetts' 4-Phase plan for reopening$.^{14}$ The initial goal for this plan was to gradually resume operation of businesses, services, and activities as the pandemic weakened; Phase 1 would have the most restrictions, as it would be earlier on in the pandemic, while Phase 4 would be preparing for a \"new normal.\" However, as expected with an international pandemic, things did not always go according to plan. Most notably, former Boston Mayor Marty Walsh rolled the city back to Phase 2, Step 2 of the reopening plan following a massive surge in holiday COVID cases. At the time—around late December and early January—most other towns in Massachusetts were in Phase 3, Step 1 of the plan, so this decision by Walsh signified a conscious effort to curb Boston's unfavorable disease trends.\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"We're going to take action now to reduce in-person activity in our city … and prevent our hospitals from getting overwhelmed,\" Walsh said at a coronavirus briefing$.^{17}$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this policy decision in mind, we began to wonder what choices other municipal governments across the United States were making with regards to COVID-19. If the city of Boston could deviate from state expectations in order to protect its citizens, were other cities doing the same? If so, were these policies effective? Through this line of thinking and questioning, we arrived at the following **research question**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> How have other U.S. cities responded to the COVID crisis, and what can they tell us about the quality of Boston’s approach, as well as the state of Boston?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind our developed research question—and the reason we find our resarch important for understanding the current state of Boston—is that, because the COVID-19 crisis is *the* most monumental current event right now, utilizing a comparative study focused on the relation between Boston's government and the virus can reveal a lot about Boston itself. In many ways, the disease has shook this country at its very foundation; From mask mandates, business closures, stimulus packages, and more, the pandemic has proven itself to be the ultimate test of effectiveness for governments, and can be used to acknowledge flaws within Boston's infrastructure. On top of this, our research goes a step further than reviewing Boston's COVID experience alone, as juxtaposing it with other US cities allows us to identify common COVID-induced problems. If an issue is shared between Boston and other cities, do the other cities handle them better? If an issue is unique to Boston, what is the historical context to said issue and how should it be addressed? Through all this, our **main goal is to reveal problems in Boston's government, infrastructure, economy, and more, and discuss ways the city may be bettered for the future.**  "

    "## Tools and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish our research goals, we used the following technologies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Jupyter Notebook (obviously)\n",
    "* Pandas\n",
    "  * CSV reading, data frame creation\n",
    "* Plotly\n",
    "  * Chloropleth map visualization\n",
    "* GeoJSON/JSON\n",
    "  * Encodes zip code boundary lines to map for our choropleth maps\n",
    "* Censusdata (Python package)\n",
    "  * Allowed us to easily retrieve data from the Census ACS and import it into Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we could begin our research, we first had to choose which other cities we would be studying in tandem with Boston. This was a crucial step in our process, as we wished to choose cities that could teach us a lot about Boston, given the time we had to work on the project. For instance, if we were to select a town in the Greater Boston area, we would anticipate that the findings would be expectedly similar to Boston itself and thus not a good choice. Conversely, though we initially thought it could be useful to study non-US cities, we eventually concluded that it would be difficult to collect such data and that potentially large cultural differences would make it difficult to comment on a US city like Boston. After some deliberation, we decided it would be best to pick a pair of US cities: one that is demographically similar to Boston, and one that is demographically different. Doing this would enable us to more easily identify any unique traits Boston may have; We would expect the demographically similar city to have similar COVID trends to Boston (vice versa for the demographically different city), so any exception would be grounds for qualitative/contextual/historical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cities we decided on are...\n",
    "* New York City, New York\n",
    "* Virginia Beach, Virginia\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons for NYC:\n",
    "* It is a Northeastern city, just like Boston.\n",
    "* It is the most populated city in the US, as well as the most dense, so we figured it would be interesting to see how they addressed these circumstances when it comes to virus containment.\n",
    "* Similar to Boston, NYC was one of the first cities in the US to be hit hard by COVID.\n",
    "* NYC is politically \"blue\", just like Boston, so we hoped to see if this influenced policy decisions.\n",
    "* COVID data was readily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons for VB:\n",
    "* It is a Southern-ish city, so environmentally quite different from Boston.\n",
    "* It is politically \"red\", so we hoped to see if republican cities had a different approach to COVID-19, and whether or not it is more effective than a democrat city such as Boston.\n",
    "* Like the name suggests, Virginia Beach has a beach and tourist economy, so we were interested to see how they handled the opening of their beaches during the pandemic, and whether or not that affected COVID rates.\n",
    "* COVID data was readily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we had the cities chosen, the next step to our approach was to create neighborhood-level chloropleth maps for each of the cities that visually depict the relationship between COVID positivity rates and a variety of Census demographic variables (these variables are explained in the *Our Datasets* section). Through these maps, we would be able to observe which variables are correlated with COVID positivity, and whether or not these correlations hold across one or more of our cities. After that, we would conduct contextual research—mainly through journalistic articles and municipal websites—to determine what policies or programs our cities have enacted to address these trends. With this, we will be able to assess how cities have tried to stop the spread of COVID, as well as how they have tried to remedy COVID-caused issues. Lastly, and the main purpose of all this, we would judge how Boston lies relative to other cities and see what conclusions can be drawn about the city of Boston. Due to the nature of our approach, our study is highly qualitative. "

    "## Our Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we gathered for our research falls into two distinct categories: COVID data and demographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### COVID Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of our chosen cities, we required ZTCA level COVID data in order to properly construct our maps. Luckily, each city's and/or state's health department readily publishes positivity rate information online.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Boston\n",
    "  * Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC)$^{11}$\n",
    "* NYC\n",
    "  * NYC Health$^{21}$\n",
    "* Virginia Beach\n",
    "  * Virginia Department of Health (VDH)$^9$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Demographic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we had COVID data for each of our cities, we then had to choose demographic variables. We would examine the relationship between these variables and the COVID positivity rates, so it was important for us to choose variables that we would expect to have some sort of correlation with the virus. Eventually, we decided on these four:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Population Density\n",
    "  * Because viruses thrive in locations with many people, we wondered if dense neighborhoods/cities struggle with COVID more and whether or not their policies are stricter because of that.\n",
    "* Wealth\n",
    "  * Examined median family income per neighborhood.\n",
    "  * COVID-19 has shook the economy to its core, so we thought it'd be interesting to see if those who are poorer suffer because of it.\n",
    "* Transportation to Work\n",
    "  * Examined means of getting to work, particularly travel by car/van.\n",
    "  * We expect public transport to have been limited/changed during the pandemic, so we wanted to see if those who travel in their own vehicles are thus less likely to have gotten the virus.\n",
    "* Race\n",
    "  * Examined proportion of White residents per neighborhood.\n",
    "  * While the relationship between race and COVID positivity is obviously not causal, race is often correlated with wealth. Because we are studying wealth, we thought it would be worthwhile then to see if race is correlated with COVID in any of our citites. \n",

Both the area and population of Boston is much smaller than that of NYC, so we would expect the rates to be homogeneous in Boston as well. We confirm that the rates in Boston have a higher variance than in the other cities:"

    "### Variable 1: Population Density\n",
    "\n",
    "In searching for what underlies this variability in Boston positivity rates, we first decided to examine population density. We assumed that places with larger population density would have greater positivity rates, as people are more likely to come into close contact with others and transmit the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boston's Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Maps/boston_density.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In Boston we see that variance in positivity rates look somewhat explained by population density, but not in the way that we expected: more densely populated areas tend to have lower positivity rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Others' Maps \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Maps/nyc_vb_density.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We see a similar trend in NYC, particularly around the Bronx and Staten Island areas. The relationship in unclear in Virginia Beach—however, the range of population density is much smaller in Virginia Beach, as is positivity rate. A difference of a few thousand people per square mile probably wouldn't cause much of a difference in positivity rates when considering the range of population densities in the other cities. Though it is interesting to note that as Virginia Beach has a much lower variance in positivity rates, they also have much lower variance in population density—Virginia Beach appears much more homogeneous across both these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thought perhaps wealth was underlying this counterintuitive trend. Maybe in more densely populated areas of these large cities—areas close to the city centers where the cost of living is higher, such as Fenway or the Seaport District in Boston and the Upper East Side in NYC—people are wealthier and they have the leisure and resources to limit their exposure to COVID by taking means such as working from home, getting delivery, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boston and Population Density\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, Boston follows the state of Massachusetts’ 4-Phase plan for reopening. Since March 22, 2021, the city has been in Phase 4, Step 1 of this plan. However, in terms of crowd control and limiting human contact, Boston has shown itself to be stricter than the state standard. For instance, when it comes to limiting public gatherings, Boston currently has a maximum of 60 indoors and 100 outdoors, as opposed to the state’s 100 and 150. Furthermore, as the state progresses to Phase 4, Step 2 of the reopening plan (effective April 30, 2021), Boston has decided to delay its own progress by three weeks.$^{14}$ Through some of these policies—along with Marty Walsh’s decision to roll back the reopening plan after the holiday season—the Boston government has acknowledged that the city’s COVID circumstances are different than other parts of Massachusetts, and thus has enacted more specific policies to reflect that.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NYC and Population Density\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Boston and Massachusetts, NYC follows New York State’s phase-based plan known as NY Forward, while also having extra guidelines through its own program called RESTART. One such guideline implemented through RESTART is that certain neighborhoods are given color labels—either Red, Orange, or Yellow—and these labels dictate the severity of restrictions on businesses and schools in that area.$^{12}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Virginia Beach and Population Density\n",
    "\n",
    "While Virginia Beach does implement the expected restrictions when it comes to outdoor gatherings (staying six feet apart, mandating masks, group capacities, etc.), it is interesting to see that their beaches have remained open through most of the pandemic.$^6$ Beaches are a significant part of their tourism industry, so the decision makes sense from an economic perspective, but this decision could prove to be a poor one as the summer approaches. Regardless, Virginia Beach still has less positivity than Boston, so this could indicate that the spread of COVID is more entrenched within the infrastructures of cities like Boston or NYC, and thus cannot be as remedied in exactly the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "* Boston and NYC have similarly strict approaches, while VB prioritizes their economy in some regards\n",
    "* In general, however, all three cities do implement expected policies when it comes to business closures, group limitations, etc.\n",
    "* Because of this, compounded with the fact that we’ve seen through our maps that population density in Boston and NYC is not correlated with COVID positivity, the containment of COVID in cities like Boston seems to be more complicated than simply limiting gatherings. Rather, more complex, infrastructural issues may explain why less dense areas seem to have more cases.\n",

People who drive to work may also work different types of jobs that require them to work in person, in contrast to people who may usually take public transport or walk to white collar jobs that can be done remotely.

We wonder if it even would have been possible or necessary to regulate such travel; A path for further research would be to more closely study the confounding factors surrounding COVID and transportation in Boston, as this could be an instance of more complex underlying factors (e.g. wealth, distance from work, public transit availability, etc.).\n",

In 2017, Boston Globe’s “Spotlight” team conducted an infamous investigation, where they discovered the average net worth for a white family in Boston was 247,000 dollars, while for black families it was 0 dollars.$^{16}$ Similar resource inequity is prevalent in healthcare as well, as during the initial stages of vaccine distribution, a Massachusetts health official described the racial disparity in vaccination rates as “really troubling”; 36% of the vaccines were going to white individuals while only 2.6% were going to black individuals.$^4$ Former Boston Mayor Marty Walsh even declared racism itself a “public health crisis”, and with this declaration he also launched the COVID-19 Health Inequities Task Force, which aims to better inform future policy decisions through the analysis and emphasis of minority COVID data.$^{18}$ Speaking on the matter of healthcare and racism, Marty Walsh said this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “There is no doubt that throughout history communities of color have faced discrimination and outright cruelty in the health care system. This is a tragic outcome from systemic racism in our country.”$^{26}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, current Boston mayor Kim Janey said this with regards to making Boston a more equitable place after the pandemic:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “We cannot go back to normal. I know, people are anxious to get on with their lives, put this pandemic behind us. And I certainly want to do that as well, put the pandemic behind us. But we have to come out of this pandemic stronger than before.” $^{23}$\n",
    "\n",
    "While it’s difficult to tell if these comments are sincere or simply empty political platitudes, it is important to keep in mind that Kim Janey has recently become the first black and female mayor of Boston. Hopefully this, as well as Marty Walsh’s decision to launch the COVID-19 Health Inequities Task Force, are indicative of a more progressive future for Boston.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NYC and Race\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Marty Walsh’s creation of the COVID-19 Health Inequities Task Force, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio has recently launched the Racial Justice Commision to combat systemic racism within the city. While Boston’s task force mainly focuses on discrimination in healthcare, the Racial Justice Commision aims to dismantle racism throughout all facets of the city. De Blasio explains the commission's goals as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Our mission is to root out systemic racism across New York City. The Racial Justice Commission has the power to put forth permanent, transformative ideas for our government and our city. This moment demands nothing less. This undertaking is unprecedented but I believe this extraordinary group of leaders, visionaries, and public servants have the ability to put forth a tangible vision to continue dismantling and obliterating centuries of racial oppression.”$^{24}$\n",
    "\n",
    "While the actual impact of this commission remains to be seen, this definitely marks a step in the right direction for the city of New York.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Virginia Beach and Race\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown by our maps, VB does not seem to have the correlation between race and COVID positivity that cities like Boston and NYC have. Interestingly, this is reflected by the fact that, through our qualitative research, we were unable to find any race-based COVID initiatives launched by the VB government. This is not to suggest that racism is negligible in VB or that race-based programs do not exist there, as private organizations such as the Hampton Roads Community Fund have been supporting black communities for years.$^2$ Rather, the lack of COVID & race-based initiatives by the VB government could suggest more about cities like Boston or NYC, where such racial trends are more apparent. Because of the more apparent issue in these cities, they have a more pressing responsibility to address it and right their past wrongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "* Boston and NYC maps have shown that COVID/race correlation is a pressing issue.\n",
    "* As such, these cities have launched initiatives to right their past wrongs.\n",
    "* Lack of such correlation and initiatives in VB emphasizes the added responsibility that cities like Boston and NYC have to address racial disparity.\n"

    "## Conclusion and Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "From a broad point of view, the cities we have studied for this project have all largely handled COVID as we would expect. Temporary business and school closures, crowd control restrictions, public transit rescheduling, and more have become universal procedures for limiting the spread of the virus. With this then, the real value of our study comes from observing government response to collateral COVID issues (such as wealth issues), and the comparative nature of our study has allowed us to clearly recognize flaws within the city of Boston. Particularly, we have seen that poverty has a universal correlation with COVID positivity across all our cities, yet the racial trend that is apparent in Boston does not exist in Virginia Beach. This distinction, along with the contextual history we have observed, reiterates Boston’s inequity problems and may explain why our observed COVID trends look the way they do. Some has already been done to address these problems in Boston, such as the various relief programs and the creation of the COVID-19 Health Inequities Task Force, but is it enough? Mayor Kim Janey was correct in saying that “we cannot go back to normal” post-pandemic; Because Boston has shown to have different issues from a city like Virginia Beach, policy-making cannot be a simple run through the motions. Rather, an active effort must be made to better the city, long after COVID is gone.\n"
